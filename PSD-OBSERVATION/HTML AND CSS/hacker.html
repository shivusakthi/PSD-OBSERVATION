<pre><h2>WHAT IS HACKER?</h2></pre>
<pre>   A hacker is an individual who uses computer, networking or other skills to overcome a technical problem.
The term also may refer to anyone who uses their abilities to gain unauthorized access to systems or networks in
order to commit crimes. A hacker may, for example, steal information to hurt people via identity theft or bring 
down a system and, often, hold it hostage in order to collect a ransom.
The term hacker has historically been a divisive one, sometimes being used as a term of admiration for individuals 
who exhibit a high degree of skill and creativity in their approach to technical problems. However, the term is 
also commonly applied to individuals who use this skill for illegal or unethical purposes.
Hacker was first used in the 1960s to describe a programmer or an individual who, in an era of highly constrained 
computer capabilities, could increase the efficiency of computer code in a way that removed, or hacked, excess 
machine code instructions from a program. It has evolved over the years to refer to someone with an advanced understanding
of computers, networking, programming or hardware.

<h2>How does hacking work?</h2>
 Hackers use technical skills to exploit cybersecurity defenses. Ethical hackers test for cybersecurity vulnerabilities and 
may take up hacking as a profession -- for example, a penetration tester (pen tester) -- or as a hobby. The end goal is 
often to gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, computing systems, mobile devices or internet of things systems. 
Many professional hackers use their skills to determine security holes in enterprise systems and then advise where companies 
should boost their security defenses to keep threat actors out.
Results can also be deleterious: Malicious hackers may steal login credentials, financial information and other types of sensitive
information.
 Many hackers aim to exploit either technical or social weaknesses to breach defenses. Technical weaknesses may include 
vulnerabilities in software or other exploitable weak spots. To exploit social weaknesses, hackers may attempt to manipulate 
social outcomes through false pretenses, such as impersonating a co-worker or other individual to gain financial or login information.
Hackers may also use their technical skills to install dangerous malware, steal or destroy data, or disrupt an organization's services.
Hackers of all types participate in forums to exchange hacking information and tradecraft. There are numerous hacker forums where 
ethical hackers can discuss or ask questions about hacking. Many of these hacker forums offer technical guides with step-by-step 
instructions on hacking.
 In contrast, forums and marketplaces serving threat actors or criminal hackers are often hosted on the dark web and provide an outlet
for offering, trading and soliciting illegal hacking services.
Criminal hackers, who sometimes lack technical skills, often use scripts and other specifically designed software programs to break 
into corporate networks. This software may manipulate network data to gather intelligence about the workings of the target system. 
These scripts can be found posted on the internet for anyone, usually entry-level hackers, to use. Hackers with limited skills are 
sometimes called script kiddies, referring to their need to use malicious scripts and their inability to create their own code. 
Advanced malicious hackers might study these scripts and then modify them to develop new methods.

<h2>What are the different types of hackers?</h2>
 In the past, the security community informally used references to hat color as a way to identify different types of hackers, 
usually divided into five main types. A few of these terms have been replaced to reflect cultural changes.
<ul>
<li><h3>Ethical hackers or authorized hackers</h3></li> -- previously known as white hat hackers -- strive to operate in the public's best 
interest rather than to create turmoil. Many ethical hackers who work doing pen testing were hired to attempt to break into the 
company's networks to find and report on security vulnerabilities. The security firms then help their customers mitigate security 
issues before criminal hackers can exploit them.
<li><h3>Threat actors or unauthorized hackers</h3></li> -- previously known as black hat hackers -- intentionally gain unauthorized access
to networks and systems with malicious intent. This includes stealing data, spreading malware or profiting from ransomware, 
vandalizing or otherwise damaging systems, often in an attempt to gain notoriety. Threat actors are criminals by definition because 
they violate laws against accessing systems without authorization, but they may also engage in other illegal activity, including 
corporate espionage, identity theft and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks.
<li><h3>Gray hat hackers</h3></li> fall somewhere between ethical hackers and threat actors. While their motives may be similar to those 
two groups, gray hats are more likely than ethical hackers to access systems without authorization; at the same time, they are more
likely than threat actors to avoid doing unnecessary damage to the systems they hack. Although they aren't typically -- or only -- 
motivated by money, gray hat hackers may offer to fix vulnerabilities they have discovered through their own unauthorized activities 
rather than using their knowledge to exploit vulnerabilities for illegal profit.
<li><h3>Red hat hackers</h3></li> also called eagle-eyed or vigilante hackers, are similar to ethical hackers. Red hat hackers intend to 
stop unethical attacks by threat actors. While red hat hackers may have a similar intent to ethical hackers, they differ in methodology,
as red hat hackers may use illegal or extreme courses of action. Often, red hat hackers will deploy cyber attacks toward the systems 
of threat actors.
<li><h3>Blue hat hackers</h3></li> also known as vengeful hackers, use hacking as a social weapon. Frequently, it is used as a means for revenge
against a person, employer or other organization. Hackers who post personal and confidential data online to ruin reputations or attempt
to gain unauthorized access to email and social media accounts are classified as blue hats.
<li><h3>Script kiddies</h3></li> are amateur, inexperienced hackers who attempt to use pre-written scripts in their hacking efforts. Often,
these are fledgling hacking enthusiasts who cause little damage.
<li><h3>Hacktivists</h3></li> are organizations of hackers that use cyber attacks to affect politically motivated change. The purpose is to 
bring public attention to something the hacktivist believes might be a violation of ethics or human rights. Hacktivism attacks may 
attempt to reveal evidence of wrongdoing by publicizing private communications, images or information.
