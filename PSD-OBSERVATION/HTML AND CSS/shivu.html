A hacker is a person skilled in information technology who uses their technical knowledge to achieve a goal or overcome an obstacle,
within a computerized system by non-standard means.Though the term hacker has become associated in popular culture with a security
hacker – someone who utilizes their technical know-how of bugs or exploits to break into computer systems and access data which would
otherwise be inaccessible to them – hacking can also be utilized by legitimate figures in legal situations. For example, law enforcement
agencies sometimes use hacking techniques in order to collect evidence on criminals and other malicious actors. This could include using 
anonymity tools (such as a VPN, or the dark web) to mask their identities online, posing as criminals themselves.Likewise, covert world 
agencies can employ hacking techniques in the legal conduct of their work. On the other hand, hacking and cyber-attacks are used extra- 
and illegally by law enforcement and security agencies (conducting warrantless activities).

<h3>Security related hacking:</h3>
Security hackers are people involved with circumvention of computer security. Among security hackers, there are several types, including:
<h3>White hat hacker:</h3>
White hats are hackers who work to keep data safe from other hackers by finding system vulnerabilities that can be mitigated.White hats 
are usually employed by the target system's owner and are typically paid (sometimes quite well) for their work. Their work is not illegal
because it is done with the system owner's consent.
<h3>Black hat hacker:</h3>
Black hats or crackers are hackers with malicious intentions. They often steal, exploit, and sell data, and are usually motivated by 
personal gain. Their work is usually illegal. A cracker is like a black hat hacker,[18] but is specifically someone who is very skilled
and tries via hacking to make profits or to benefit, not just to vandalize. Crackers find exploits for system vulnerabilities and often 
use them to their advantage by either selling the fix to the system owner or selling the exploit to other black hat hackers, who in turn
use it to steal information 
or gain royalties.
<h3>Grey hat hacker:</h3>
A grey hat is a computer hacker or computer security expert who may sometimes violate laws or typical ethical standards, but does not 
have the malicious intent typical of a black hat hacker.</pre>
