When hacking first started it was not thought of as that serious.
The hackers were not even known as hackers but as practical jokers.
The very first hack came in 1878 when the phone company, Bell 
Telephone, was started. A group of teenage boys, hired to run the 
switchboards, would disconnect or misdirect calls.

The first authentic computer hackers came in the 1960s.
During those times, computers were mainframes, locked 
away in temperature controlled, glassed in areas. 
It cost a lot of money to run these machines, so programmers 
had limited access to them. The smarter students, usually MIT 
students, had an insatiable curiosity about how things worked. 
So, the smartest ones created what they called "hacks", 
programming shortcuts, to complete computing tasks more quickly. 
In some cases the shortcuts were better than the original program. 
One of the hacks that was created in the 60s, 1969 to be exact, was
created to act as an open set of rules to run machines on the 
computer frontier. It was created by two employees from the Bell Lab's
think tank. The two employees were Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson and 
the "hack" was called UNIX.</td></tr></table>

In the 1970s, the world was primed and ready for hackers. For hackers, 
it was all about exploring and figuring out how the wired world worked. 
This is the year that hacking went from being a practical joke to serious 
business.

The first major hacking came in 1971, by a vietnam vet named John Draper. 
He figured out a way to make free phone calls. This was later called "Phreaking". 
Abbie Hoffman followed John Drapers lead with "The Youth International Party Line" newsletter. 
However, the only thing missing from the hacking world was a meeting area. So, in 1978 two guys
from Chicago, Randy Seuss and Ward Christiansen, created the first personal computer bulletin 
board system. This system is still in operation even today.</td></tr></table>

In the 1980s, hacking reached the peak of seriousness. By 1980, there was
over a total of one million units being used in the U.S. By 1983, there 
were over 10 million units. By 1986, there were over 30 million. So, as you 
can see computer use increased drastically during the 80s.

The reason for this drastic increase in computer use was because of IBM. 
In, 1981 IBM announced "personal computers. It was stand alone machine, 
fully loaded with a CPU, software, memory, utilities, storage, etc. You 
could go anywhere and do anything on these computers. In 1983, a movie 
called War Games came out. This was the first movie to show the inner
workings of hackers. For audiences nationwide this movie served as a
warning. The territory was changing. More people were moving into the 
online world. ARPANET was changing into the Internet and popularity of
bulletin board systems were beginning to take off.In Milwaukee a group of
hackers called 414 broke into systems at institutions ranging from the 
Los Alamos Laboratories to Manhattan's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. 
Then the cops shut them down. The great rivalry started between two groups 
called lOD and MOD. This rivalry was called "The Great Hacker War". A man who 
called himself Lex Luthor founded the Legion of Doom. It was named after a 
Saturday morning cartoon.The LOD had a reputation of attracting the best of the
best, until one of their brightest members, Phiber Optik, feuded with Legion of 
Doomer, Erik Bloodaxe and got kicked out of the clubhouse. He and some of his 
friends then formed a rival group called, the Masters of Deception.Starting in 1990,
LOD and MOD were involved in online warfare for almost two years. They were jamming 
phone lines, monitoring calls and trespassing in each other's private computers. 
Things got so bad that the Fed's stepped in to put a stop to it. Phiber and his 
friends were then sent to jail. This is what put an end to the era.</tr></td></table>
